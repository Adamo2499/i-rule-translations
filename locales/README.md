# locales
Locales are denoted by their ISO-compliant two-letter language keys (i.e. `English` is `en`, `Russian` is `ru`).

To start translating, create a copy of `en.json` and rename it to the appropriate language code. Then start translating.

## Localizing Images
Currently, there are several images that need to be localized. You can view a list of localizable images in the `./locales/assets_ru/` folder. Please view `ru.json` for an example of using these localized sprites.
